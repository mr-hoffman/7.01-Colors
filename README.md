# 7.01-Colors

In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors and build a function to combine two colors.

## Background

* RGB is one way of storing color data. R stands for red, G for green, and B for blue. Each color is given a value from 0 to 255 (can you figure out why we use this number range?).
* You can use this tool to find the valus for different colors: http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm

## Lab

1. Create a class called `Color` (remember, class names are capitalized)
2. Your class should have an attribute for each of the color values required, r, g, and b
3. Instantiate at least 3 different color objects
4. Create a function called `add_colors()` which takes in two colors and returns a new color object that is the average of the two reds, greens, and blues.
